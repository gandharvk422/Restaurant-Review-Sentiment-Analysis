# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project was developed as a task assigned by **SkyHighes Technologies** during my internship as an AI-ML intern. The main objective of this project is to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative based on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used, `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`, consists of user reviews with corresponding labels indicating whether the review was positive (liked) or negative (not liked). The project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification model training.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **`Notebook.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains the complete workflow, including data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization), training a classification model, and evaluating the performance.

- **`Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`**: The dataset consisting of restaurant reviews and their sentiment labels (1 for liked, 0 for not liked).

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/gandharvk422/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis"
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `Notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- The dataset contains restaurant reviews with corresponding sentiment labels.
- The model is trained to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
- You can modify the code to experiment with different machine learning algorithms or NLP techniques for better results.
